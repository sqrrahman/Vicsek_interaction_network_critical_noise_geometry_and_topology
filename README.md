This repository contains code templates for:

1. Running Vicsek simulations up to steady state,
2. Generating snapshots after reaching steady state,
3. Identifying and analyzing the clusters formed in the snapshots,
4. Post-processing the sampled snapshots,
5. Plotting figures based on the processed data.

Additional codes are provided for generating animations/movies after steady state and for plotting the largest clusters.
