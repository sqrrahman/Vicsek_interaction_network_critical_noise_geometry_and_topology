This repository contains codes for:
1. Running Vicsek simulations up to steady state.
2. Generating snapshots after reaching steady state.
3. Identifying and analyzing the clusters formed in the snapshots.
4. Post-processing the sampled snapshots.
5. Plotting figures based on the processed data.

Additional codes are provided for:
